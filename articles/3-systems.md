## Salience Network
The term “salience network” refers to a suite of brain regions whose cortical hubs are the anterior cingulate and ventral anterior insular (i.e. frontoinsular) cortices.

#### William W. Seeley's take
the frontoinsula was a major afferent cortical hub for perceiving viscero-autonomic feedback, while the ACC was the efferent hub responsible for generating relevant visceral, autonomic, behavioral, and cognitive responses

The network identified by Dosenbach et al, now often referred to as the “cingulo opercular task-control network” is anchored by the dorsal aINS (a nearly VEN-free aINS subregion) and the adjacent frontal operculum and appears critical for task set initiation and maintenance, perhaps by providing the sustained vigilance or “tonic alertness” (Sadaghiani et al., 2010) required to enter and stay in a behavioral or cognitive set. In contrast, the nearby salience network is anchored by the more ventral frontoinsula (where VENs are abundantly found), and represents, in my way of thinking, the homeostatic system whose job is, in part, to engage the task-control network so it can (1) maintain the most relevant task set for as long as the salient stimulus complex remains or (2) orchestrate switching to a new task set (and relevant network configuration) in response to shifts in the salience landscape

(My take):
cingulo opercular network(dorsal aINS)就像一个执行器，负责执行“task set initiation and maintenance”，有点像一个容器编排工具kubernetes，哈哈。
而salience net(ventral frontoinsula)负责处理salience信号，决定“the most relevant task set”，并且决定怎么switch

#### Salience signals?
(1) the noradrenergic system, anchored 158 by the locus ceruleus and thought to increase signal-to-noise within cortical networks in response to 159 salience and 
(2) the mesolimbic dopamine system, anchored by the ventral tegmental area (among 160 other sites) and thought to provide signals related to error, reward, and novelty.

Overall, the studies reviewed here support the idea that the salience network hubs, whatever 183 else they may be doing, are intimate partners for conscious integration of autonomic feedback and 184 responses with internal goals and environmental demands.

The right dAIC is considered to be a unique brain region, functioning as a hub that influences both the FPN and DMN (Uddin, 2015)

#### Network Dysfunction
Overactivity in the AI-dACC pathway is mainly associated with affective disorders (high anxiety) and neuroticism (Massullo et al., 2020).

aINS overactivation/stronger connectivity between dACC and new cortex regions can be related with anxiety and even perceived level of pain. 因为你会觉得什么事情都“很重要”，导致anxious

Functional MRI data suggests that at least three subdivisions can be recognized within the insula on the basis of differential FC patterns: a dorsal anterior (dAI) involved in high-level cognitive control processes (activated by tasks requiring attention and redirecting information to the DLPFC-PPC loop), a ventral anterior (vAI) involved in affective processes (responsible for the flow of affective stimuli to specialized areas within the limbic cortex and medial prefrontal cortex), and a posterior insula (PI) involved in sensorimotor processing (Deen et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2013).

很有意思，redirecting information to the DLPFC-PPC loop

The SN with a low threshold for perceived saliency is not able to efficiently regulate the DMN and FPN switching (Weng et al., 2019).

## Default Mode Network

### Original paper: Greicius et al., 2003(Michael D Greicius)
Alzheimer-type dementia is indeed associated with 207 DMN-localized atrophy, hypometabolism, and disrupted intrinsic connectivity

### Functions
- encoding and retrieval of episodic memory
- active semantic processing
- self-representation
- prospective planning
- social reasoning
- mental time travel

### Structures

- _[Posterior cingulate cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cingulate_cortex) (PCC) & [precuneus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precuneus "Precuneus")_: Combines bottom-up (not controlled) attention with information from memory and perception. The ventral (lower) part of PCC activates in all tasks which involve the DMN including those related to the self, related to others, remembering the past, thinking about the future, and processing concepts plus spatial navigation. The dorsal (upper) part of PCC involves involuntary awareness and arousal. The precuneus is involved in visual, sensorimotor, and attentional information.
- _[Medial prefrontal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_prefrontal_cortex "Medial prefrontal cortex") (mPFC)_: Decisions about self-processing such as personal information, autobiographical memories, future goals and events, and decision making regarding those personally very close such as family. The ventral (lower) part is involved in positive emotional information and internally valued reward.
- _[Angular gyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_gyrus "Angular gyrus")_: Connects perception, attention, spatial cognition, and action and helps with parts of recall of episodic memories.

#### Retrospective
he DMN is active during tasks requiring autobiographical memory, prospective thinking, ego/allocentric spatial reference, and understanding of others’ intentions


Recent work, however, has challenged a specific mapping between the default mode network and mind-wandering, given that the system is important in maintaining detailed representations of task information during working memory encoding.

Studies have shown that when people watch a movie,[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-34) listen to a story,[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-Simony2016-36) or read a story,[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-37) their DMNs are highly correlated with each other. DMNs are not correlated if the stories are scrambled or are in a language the person does not understand, suggesting that the network is highly involved in the comprehension and the subsequent memory formation of that story.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-Simony2016-36) The DMN is shown to even be correlated if the same story is presented to different people in different languages,[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-38) further suggesting the DMN is truly involved in the comprehension aspect of the story and not the auditory or language aspect.

The default mode network is deactivated during some external goal-oriented tasks such as visual attention or cognitive [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory "Working memory") tasks.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-Fox2005-7) However, with internal goal-oriented tasks, such as social working memory or autobiographical tasks, the DMN is positively activated with the task and correlates with other networks such as the network involved in [executive function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions "Executive functions").[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-Spreng2012-8) Regions of the DMN are also activated during cognitively demanding tasks that require higher-order conceptual representations.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-Murphy-DistantInput-2018-10) The DMN shows higher activation when behavioral responses are stable, and this activation is independent of self-reported mind wandering.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-39) Meditation, which involves focusing the mind on breathing and relaxation, is associated with reduced activity of the DMN.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-pmid34147013-40)

Gabrielle et al. (2019) suggests that the DMN is related to the perception of beauty, in which the network becomes activated in a generalized way to aesthetically moving domains such as artworks, landscapes, and architecture. This would explain a deep inner feeling of pleasure related to [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"), interconnected with the sense of personal identity, due to the network functions related to the [self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self "Self").[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network#cite_note-41)



The DMN falls at the most extreme transmodal end of this spectrum, which may enable neural signals within it to integrate signals from other brain regions, providing top-down predictions to lower levels in the hierarchy.
it is assumed to support neural contexts that reflect more integrated patterns of cognition, including those taking place during a task

the role of the angular gyri is to allocate attention to complex memory representations.

The ventral anterior temporal lobes are thought to provide a “graded hub” in which different unimodal features are gradually integrated to form heteromodal concepts, with visual information reaching this region along the ventral visual pathway (fusiform cortex), auditory and motor information arriving from superior temporal gyrus and frontal cortex, and social/emotional information merging from the temporal pole (Ralph et al., 2017).


#### In self-referential judgements
the PCC may up-regulate activity of other DMN nodes during self-related mental processes, consistent with its role as a hub node in the DMN35. 
In contrast, the mPFC is more specifically engaged by demands for cognitive elaboration, evaluation, and emotion reappraisal37, 
while the left AG is involved in the retrieval of semantic and personally relevant information38,39.

In summary, the mPFC, PCC and left AG constitute a core self-referential system within the DMN, sustained by activity in the PCC and regulated by feedback from the mPFC whose influence is enhanced with more effortful self-directed cognition35.
#### In social cognition
Dissociable roles for PCC and mPFC in social functioning have been reported, with the PCC differentially involved in self-other distinctions43, and the mPFC in monitoring both one’s own and others’ mental states40,43. The right AG and adjoining temporal parietal junction preferentially encode “other relevant” information, such as the mental states and beliefs of others, and predict others’ behaviors during social interaction44.  

An innovative research direction using naturalistic stimuli has demonstrated that ongoing DMN activity of two individuals becomes synchronized when they process shared narratives, with DMN synchronization being particularly sensitive to social communicative cues45. Recent studies have also shown that inter-individual neural synchronization in the DMN is related to social proximity, reflecting evaluation of whether other individuals are friends, friends-of-friends, or more distally connected in social ties46. Inter-individual DMN synchronization may underlie similar mental representations, reflecting shared values and beliefs, as well as a similar “style” of perceiving the world.

#### In episodic memory
PCC with autobiographical recall, RSC with spatial navigation, mPFC with regulation of memory encoding and recall, and AG with elaboration of the contents of memory48.
The contributions of the MTL and cortical nodes of the DMN to memory operations can be dissociated49, with hippocampal activity tracking successful encoding and retrieval, and cortical nodes tracking recall of the detailed value- and emotion-related features of autobiographical memory.

#### In language and semantic memory
Overlap with the speech and language processing system is particularly evident in the left AG, anterior temporal cortex (ATC), and MTG across a wide range of semantic tasks that assess the ability to use, manipulate and generalize knowledge55

#### In mind wandering
consistent recruitment of the mPFC, PCC, MTL, and AG67

#### PCC for event boundaries?
Neural activation patterns in the PCC tend to persist for extended periods of time during naturalistic movie watching, and transition points coincide with perceived event boundaries94,95


### Conclusion? In cognitive functions
For example, the PCC and mPFC are differentially involved in self-other distinctions, RSC in spatial memory, precuneus in visual imagery, the hippocampus in episodic memory formation, the ATC in semantic memory, the left AG in language-related semantic judgements, the right AG in social-evaluative functions, the left MTG in monitoring internal speech, and the mPFC in value judgements, emotion regulation, and generation and elaboration of stimulus independent thoughts.

#### Internal narrative and epistemic self
I propose that the DMN is an integrative system which facilitates the construction of an ongoing internal narrative drawing on the key cognitive elements I have highlighted above. These narratives shape our understanding of our individual, highly personal, experiences.

Such a narrative is central to construction of the “epistemic self”, component processes of which include episodic memories, semantic knowledge of facts about one’s life and the world, representations of individual values and beliefs, and the ability to experience and produce evaluative directions to our perceptions, actions, and reasoning78,79

#### Broadcasting to many other networks
I further posit that the DMN integrates component processes and broadcasts them globally to construct and maintain an experience of subjective continuity.

DMN nodes are well placed to integrate and broadcast neural representations. Several lines of research have highlighted the unique structural and functional characteristics that enable DMN nodes to serve as a signaling hub in the brain

#### Integrating information on a higher(highest?) level
DMN nodes are located at one extreme of a functional hierarchy, along a spectrum from unimodal to heteromodal brain regions, allowing it to integrate structured information from multiple brain areas

#### Memory formation(episodic?经过加工)
the DMN had significantly greater net causal outflow to other brain networks including sensory and motor networks than the reverse, during the resting-state, and during episodic memory formation, and the strength of causal interactions was higher during memory formation compared to the resting state91.

#### Conclusion
First, salient stimuli induce external event-driven network switching which shapes the dynamic role of the DMN in cognition. Processing of salient stimuli results in suppression of the DMN during attentionally demanding tasks, and this suppression is followed by a rebound and return to internally focused mental states. Second, DMN nodes are involved in multiple overlapping cognitive functions as determined with experimental paradigms that manipulate various aspects of self-reference, social cognition, language and semantic memory, and episodic memory. Third, the DMN integrates cognitive operations supported by its individual nodes to sustain an “internal narrative” characterized by distinct brain states and “frames of thought”. Fourth, the hub properties of the DMN facilitate internal event-driven network switching and global state changes which lead to new frames of thought. Mind wandering, one of the cognitive functions ascribed to the DMN, is a natural outcome of this dynamical process.Appropriately directed, these frames of thought and shifts in frames of thought (mind wandering), may support creative problem solving, while misdirection of this process leads to attentional lapses and maladaptive behaviors65,102.


## Central Executive Network(Frontoparietal Network, FPN)
FPN activity is significantly negatively correlated with DMN (Uddin and Menon, 2009), and its activation is relatively strongest during cognitive effort. Its function is primarily related to task selection and executive function, using input from other brain networks to actively process information, and supporting higherorder cognitive functions, such as attentional control and working memory. The FPN is also essential for decision-making in the context of goal-directed behavior in rule-based problem-solving (Lindquist and Barrett, 2012). It connects the lateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; Seeley et al., 2007).
